# The Genre, and Why	

Casual gaming went mobile a few years back. Command-based [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-User_Dungeon) and [text adventure games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) are hard to use without a full-size keyboard, (although there are [browser-based clients](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/tag/rpg) and [connectors](http://www.mudconnect.com/)) . Single-player [choice-based games](http://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/) found success in the mobile space, as did (simplified) graphical RPGs. 

**The basic genre we're targeting is the [Online text-based role playing game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_text-based_role-playing_game).** Then, adding collaborative editing, as existed to some extent in [Addventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addventure) or role-playibg [MU*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU*) games.


My personal goal is to see what happens when we can combine agless, enduring concepts such

## What exists already?

Google [text rpg](https://www.google.com/search?q=text+rpg) and you'll find a lot of results, although nearly will be traditional MUDs that require a telnet client and a good keyboard.

Please add any games to this list that appear to be multiplayer text-based RPGs that are natively HTML/HTTP based.

1. [Legend of the Green Dragon](http://www.lotgd.net/) and other games based on [the engine](http://www.dragonprime.net/), such as the popular [HogwartsLive](http://www.hogwartslive.com/) are purely hyperlink navigable, and could be played from a mobile device if they had been designed with that in mind. The PHP engine appears to strain its performance limits at around 30-80 active players, however.

2. [Sryth](http://www.sryth.com/), another choice/navigation driven game, also seems as if it could have been adapted. [Torn](http://www.torn.com/), however, does not - it has a very complex interface, even though it is natively HTML.

Note that games from [Iron Realms](http://www.ironrealms.com/), like [Lusternia](http://www.lusternia.com/), [Achaea](http://www.achaea.com/), [Aetolia](http://www.aetolia.com/), [Midkemia](http://www.midkemiaonline.com/), and [Imperian](http://www.imperian.com/) are really MUDs, but offer a desktop-only HTML5 client that can offer clickable command prompts. On mobile, you'd need a regular MUD client.

Also, [Twinery](http://twinery.org/) is a story editor for single-player text games.
